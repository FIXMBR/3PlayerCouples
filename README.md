# 3PlayerCouples
Original script by SpootyBiscuit 

Current usage:

- copy cybercouples to your noteskin folder (or you can change 3rd player noteskin in `sm.py`)
- create couples (routine) chart preferably in arrowvortex
- create doubles chart (for the third player)

- run the `rich.py`, it requires python 3
- enter your globaloffset and set the noteskin for the third player

# TODO
- Songs with variable BPM are not supported
- ~~Make the chart automatically  generate from 1 couples chart and 1 doubles chart (instead of relying on the user to copy it)~~
- ~~Convert it to Python 3~~ Done!
- a lot more...
