Also works with 4 players

# Current usage:

[Downloads](https://github.com/FIXMBR/3PlayerCouples/releases/)

1. copy couplesp3 to your noteskin folder (or you can change 3rd player noteskin in the UI)
2. create couples (routine) chart preferably in arrowvortex
3. create doubles chart (for the third player) with the same difficulty as routine
  - backup your sm file before conversion, any file specified as an output will be overwritten, and your original - "source" charts will be lost
  - for four players conversion you need to have 2 routine charts with the same name, the one with lower difficulty will be converted to players 1 and 2, the other one will be 3 and 4
4. run `triples.exe` or `triples.py` - it requires python 3
5. set the noteskin for the third player and run
  -noteskin2 is for player 4
  -for 4 players conversion click the checkbox
6. select your source `.sm` file, then select your `default.xml`
  -make sure the output file is the only .sm file in song folder, also you probably need to restart nITG
